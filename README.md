Login and Register Form
====================================

A login and signup form using HTML, PHP, and MySQL. This form allows users to register and login. 
All information is stored in a MySQL database. After successful login the user is redirected to their dashboard.
I enjoy making software so much! Please, if you see any issues make them known!
